# PRODIGY_DS_05

## US Accident Data Analysis:
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on US accident data. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents.

### Repository structure:
PRODIGY_DS_05.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

#### project preview:
In this project, I perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on US accident data to uncover insights and patterns. The process involves the following steps:

1.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data cleaning, and preparation.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data better.
3.Visualization: Various plots and graphs to represent the findings.

##### key findings:
1.Accident Trends: Analysis of accident trends over time, including peak hours, days, and months.
2.Geographical Insights: Understanding the geographical distribution of accidents.
3.Weather Conditions: Impact of weather conditions on the occurrence of accidents.
